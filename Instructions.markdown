# Doc Template for Library Plugins

## Overview

These template files will help you write documentation for _library_ plugins.

If you wish to create a [library plugin](http://docs.coronalabs.com/native/plugin/index.html#types-of-plugins), you can code it in 2 ways:

* Lua code. It's much easier to create a plugin that works cross-platform, but you are limited to what's available in the Lua API's. To create a new project, use the [Project Template for Library Plugins (Lua)](https://github.com/coronalabs/plugins-template-library-lua). 
* Native code. You have to generate binaries for each platform, but you have complete access to the native API's of the underlying platform. To create a new project, use the 'App' template that's available in the CoronaEnterprise install.


## Hosting

In order to distribute your plugin to the Corona Store, you must post documentation for your plugin online.

To simplify the hosting of your plugin documentation, we have designed these template files to be hosted as a public github repository.

As a starting point, we recommend you copy, clone or fork this repository.


## Files

This template provides the stub markdown files:

* [Readme.markdown](Readme.markdown)
	+ This is the main library index page.
	+ You should list all functions and properties here.
* [FUNCTION.markdown](FUNCTION.markdown)
	+ This is a template for all library functions.
	+ You should duplicate this file for each function in the library.
* [PROPERTY.markdown](PROPERTY.markdown)
	+ This is a template for all library properties (e.g. version information)
	+ You should duplicate this file for each property in the library.

NOTE: The files in ALL CAPS are stub files. The actual names of the files should match the case of the corresponding function/property names.


## Markdown Guidelines

The template files are based on markdown. 

Please consult [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) for guidelines for more information.

### Conventions

In the template files, there are various words that are written in all-caps. We recommend that you do a *bulk* find/replace before you start the actual documentation writing process. This will ensure your docs are consistent.

Some examples of bulk find/replace are shown below for a fictitious 'binaryjson' plugin developed by the fictitious 'MyCompany' developer:

* `wattageTileEngine` => `binaryjson`
* `FUNCTION` => `encode()`
* `PROPERTY` => `version`
* `TYPE` => `[String](http://docs.coronalabs.com/api/type/String.html)`
* `contact@blindprophetsoftware.com` => `support@mycompany.com`
* `Blind Prophet Software, LLC` => `MyCompany`
* `http://www.blindprophetsoftware.com` => `http://mycompany.com/`
* `http://blindprophetsoftware.boards.net` => `http://mycompany.com/forums/binaryjson`
* `com.blindprophetsoftware` => `com.mycompany`
* `SAMPLE_CODE_URL` => `http://github.com/mycompany/binaryjson-sample`
